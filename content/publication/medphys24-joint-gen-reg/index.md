abstract: "The use of Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging for proton therapy treatment planning is gaining attention as a highly effective method for guidance. At the core of this approach is the generation of Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR scans. However, the critical issue in this process is accurately aligning the MR and CT images, a task that becomes particularly challenging in frequently moving body areas, such as the head-and-neck. Misalignments in these images can result in blurred synthetic CT (sCT) images, adversely affecting the precision and effectiveness of the treatment planning." 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "In this study, we developed an approach that substantially improves the anatomical accuracy of synthetic CT (sCT) images for MR-based radiotherapy planning. By integrating image generation with the deformable registration processes, the novel framework effectively addresses the inherent challenges in MR-CT registration and sCT evaluation. The methodological synergy of generation and registration networks, coupled with a strategic approach to proton dose planning, contributes to enhancing treatment planning accuracy. This study represents a meaningful step forward in the application of MR-based proton treatment planning and daily adaptive replanning, offering potential improvements in reducing the imaging-related dose and patient outcomes in the field of radiotherapy."
