abstract: "Intra-fraction motion in radiotherapy is commonly modeled using deformable image registration (DIR). However, existing methods often struggle to balance speed and accuracy, limiting their applicability in clinical scenarios. This study introduces a novel approach that harnesses Neural Graphics Primitives (NGP) to optimize the displacement vector field (DVF). Our method leverages learned primitives, processed as splats, and interpolates within space using a shallow neural network. Uniquely, it enables self-supervised optimization at an ultra-fast speed, negating the need for pre-training on extensive datasets and allowing seamless adaptation to new cases. We validated this approach on the 4D-CT lung dataset DIR-lab, achieving a target registration error (TRE) of 1.15Â±1.15 mm within a remarkable time of 1.77 seconds. Notably, our method also addresses the sliding boundary problem, a common challenge in conventional DIR methods."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "In this study, we have successfully integrated NGP into DIR, a novel contribution that significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of medical image alignment as demonstrated on the DIR-lab dataset. The NGPDIR framework exhibits robust performance across various metrics, particularly in landmark alignment precision and the accommodation of anatomical sliding boundaries. This advancement not only propels the DIR field forward but also opens new avenues for real-time clinical applications, potentially transforming patient care with its rapid, reliable imaging capabilities."
