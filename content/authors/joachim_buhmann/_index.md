Joachim M. Buhmann is full Professor for Computer Science at ETH Zurich since October 2003.

Joachim M. Buhmann, who was born in 1959, is from Friedrichshafen, Germany. He received a diploma in physics in 1985 and a PhD in 1988, both from the Technical University of Munich. Afterwards, he spent three years as research associate and research assistant professor at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. In 1991 he joined the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California. From 1992 until 2003 he was a professor for practical computer science at the University of Bonn.

His research interests cover the area of pattern recognition and data analysis, i.e., machine learning, statistical learning theory and applied statistics. The application areas range from computer vision and image analysis, remote sensing to bioinformatics. He is a member of the Technical Committee of the German Pattern Recognition Society (DAGM) since 1995. He also serves on the board of IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and of IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.
