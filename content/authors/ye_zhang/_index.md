Dr Ye Zhang received her PhD from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHz) in 2013 and subsequently worked as a research scientist in Varian Medical Systems before re-joining Paul Scherrer Institut in 2016 as a postdoc researcher. She has been a tenure-track scientist since 2018 and was successfully tenured in 2022. Her main research interests lie in developing 4D treatments for scanned proton therapy, especially for 4D treatment planning and optimisation, image guidance, motion modelling and real-time adaptive radiotherapy. In addition, she is exploring the potential of artificial intelligence, upright treatment and online MR guidance for proton therapy.
