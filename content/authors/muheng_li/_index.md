Currently, Muheng Li is a joint doctoral student at Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) and ETH Zurich, supervised by Prof. Antony Lomax and Dr. Ye Zhang. Before, I graduated with a M.S degree from the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, where I was advised by Prof. Jiwen Lu and Prof. Jianjiang Feng. I also had my bachelor's degree at the department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University.

Now, Muheng working at PSIâ€™s Center for Proton Therapy, where he is deeply involved in the intersection of AI technology and radiation therapy. The core of my research is focused on addressing the complex challenges associated with 4D data analysis and modeling.

The dynamic nature of organs in motion during therapy sessions produces intricate 4D data. In my earlier academic journey, my research was concentrated on computer vision and deep learning, specifically generative 3D vision and multi-modal video learning. Building on my background, he is dedicated to advancing the methodologies for 4D data analysis, aiming to enhance the precision and effectiveness of proton therapy for cancer treatment.
