Xia Li is now a joint doctoral student of ETH Zurich and Paul Sherrer Institut, supervised by Prof. Joachim Buhmann, Prof. Antony Lomax and Dr. Ye Zhang. Previously, I obtained my Master’s and Bachlor’s degree from Peking University and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, respectively. During my postgrade, I was fortunate to work with Prof. Hong Liu and Prof. Zhouchen Lin.

Now my research interest lies in the intersection of image processing technique and radiation therapy. My ultimate goal of my research is to reducing the cost of proton therapy from the algorithm perspective, and make it affordable by average people. Before studying medical image processing, I mainly work on image and video segmentation. I also have experience on image restoration and data mining.
